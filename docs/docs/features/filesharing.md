# File Sharing

MijnBureau offers two secure, user-friendly file sharing and syncing options: Nextcloud and LaSuite Drive. Both are integrated into the platform, allowing teams to easily upload, share, edit, and sync files.

- Nextcloud: A mature, enterprise-grade solution with comprehensive features such as version control, shared folders, and collaborative editing.
- LaSuite Drive: Developed by the French government and currently in the incubation phase, LaSuite Drive is a promising alternative with a focus on simplicity and privacy.

Below are examples of both solutions.
