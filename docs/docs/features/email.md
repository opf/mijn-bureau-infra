# Email

The Email feature is not yet available in MijnBureau. However, it is actively being developed and will be introduced in a future release.

Below are previews of two possible products. Open-XChange and LaSuite messages. Open-Xchange is an enterprise ready product used by millions of users daily. LaSuite messages is an incubating product developed by the french government but has a promising future base on the new feature of collaborative emails.
