# Email

The Email feature is not yet available in MijnBureau. It is currently under active development and will be introduced in a future release.

Below are previews of two products we are evaluating:

- Open-XChange — an enterprise‑ready mail platform used by many organizations; mature and proven in large deployments.
- LaSuite Messages — an incubating project from the French government with promising collaborative email capabilities that could add new workflows.

Feedback on which option to prioritize is welcome.
