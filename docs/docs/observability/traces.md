# Traces

Tracing tools such as [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/) and [Tempo](https://grafana.com/oss/tempo/) can be integrated to visualize and analyze request flows across multiple applications. Tracing helps developers and operators understand how requests propagate through the system, making it easier to diagnose performance issues and pinpoint bottlenecks.

At this time, MijnBureau does not include built-in support for distributed tracing.

Our software is tested on [HavenPlus](https://havenplus.commonground.nl/docs/overview) compliant clusters, which you can use as a reference for your own setup.
