# Upstream Products

MijnBureau relies on upstream open source products to build its suite. All integrated products are open source.

If MijnBureau or a service integrator discovers an issue, they may either build a custom container to address it or submit a pull request (PR) to the upstream project. It is the responsibility of the upstream maintainers to review PRs promptly. If issues are not resolved in a reasonable timeframe, MijnBureau should reconsider using that product and look for alternatives.
