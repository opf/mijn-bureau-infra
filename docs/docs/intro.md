# Introduction

MijnBureau is a flexible and secure digital workplace suite. Its primary goal is to provide an **autonomous** solution for digital workplaces, ensuring you can run everything on your own hardware while maintaining full control over your critical data.

Developed in collaboration with Dutch municipalities, provinces, and ministries, MijnBureau draws inspiration from similar initiatives like Germany’s Opendesk and France’s LaSuite.

Although MijnBureau is a public-driven initiative, its licensing encourages private sector actors to use, sell, and contribute to the project.
